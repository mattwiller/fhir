    <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>This resource supports use cases for creation of and querying for medication information
            including attributes such as medication classifications, images of medications, costs
            and/or coverages, etc. This resource can be used to return medication information as part of a
            formulary or a catalogue.</p>
		<p> Where the Medication resource is intended for the simple identification of a medication for prescribing, dispensing, or administering, the MedicationKnowledge resource is intended to provide more detailed information about the medication.  Unlike the MedicinalProductDefinition resource, the MedicationKnowledge resource is not a complete definition of the medication but provides some definitional information along with formulary/catalogue-specific information such as costs, monitoring programs, etc.</p>
